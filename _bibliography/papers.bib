  abstract = {Clonal tree inference brings crucial insights to the analysis of
              tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution. Recent progress in single
              cell sequencing has prompted a demand for more advanced
              probabilistic models of copy number evolution, coupled with
              inference methods which can account for the noisy nature of the
              data along with dependencies between adjacent sites in copy number
              profiles. We present VICTree, a variational inference based
              algorithm for joint Bayesian inference of clonal trees, together
              with a novel Tree-structured Mixture Hidden Markov Model (TSMHMM)
              which combines HMMs related through a tree with a mixture model.
              For the tree inference, we introduce a new algorithm, LARS, for
              sampling directed labeled multifurcating trees. To evaluate our
              proposed method, we conduct experiments on simulated data and on
              samples of multiple myeloma and breast cancer. We demonstrate
              VICTree{\textquoteright}s capacity for reliable clustering, clonal
              tree reconstruction, copy number evolution and the utility of the
              ELBO for model selection. Lastly, VICTree{\textquoteright}s results
              are compared in terms of quality and speed of inference to other
              state-of-the-art methods. The code for VICTree is available on
