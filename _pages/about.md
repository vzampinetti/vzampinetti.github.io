I develop machine learning methods and algorithms with a mathematical and statistical approach,
and test their application to DNA sequencing data (both single-cell and bulk) from patients with cancer.
My predominantly engineering background, with a focus on data science, merges with my passion
for probabilistic models. My research involves the definition and analysis of Bayesian inference
algorithms such as Variational Inference, as well as maximum likelihood methods (EM), which enable
the reconstruction of cancer evolutionary trees from high-dimensional and inherently noisy data.
Additionally, I develop efficient methods for sampling trees and generate synthetic data for testing
implementations before the application on real data.

As a part of my PhD student plan, I also assisted for two consecutive years in teaching of the MSc course
[Statistical Models](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01VJWNG&p_a_acc=2024&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N),
for which I wrote a book about the basics of modern _R_ in statistical analysis,
fully available [here](https://toyo97.github.io/statistical-models-r/).
