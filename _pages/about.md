Hi there! I am a PhD student in probabilistic modeling and computational biology at
[Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) in Italy, under a co-tutelle
with [KTH](https://www.kth.se), Stockholm.

Together with my advisor [Jens Lagergren](https://lagergrenlab.org/)
I develop machine learning methods and algorithms with a mathematical and statistical approach,
and test their application to DNA sequencing data (both single-cell and bulk) from patients with cancer.
We use [VI](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods) and [EM](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm)
methods to infer the evolutionary history of cancer cells from copy-number profiles.

As a part of my PhD student plan, I also assisted Prof. [Mauro
Gasparini](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=002692) for two consecutive years
in teaching of the MSc course [Statistical
Models](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01VJWNG&p_a_acc=2024&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N),
for which I wrote a book about the basics of modern _R_ in statistical
analysis, fully available
[here](https://toyo97.github.io/statistical-models-r/).
